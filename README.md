### *Resources*

[Complete Interview Preparation GFG Course](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/complete-interview-preparation)<br>
I would highly recommend this course. It includes detailed Lectures, Quizzes, FAQs, Doubt Forums and covers all topics mentioned above along with C++, Java, Aptitude & Logical Reasoning and Mock tests


## **1. Operating Systems<br>**
[GateSmashers OS Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxCzCOWd7aiGz9donHRrE9I3Mwn6XdP8p)- Full course content covered <br>
[Memory Management Unit(MMU) by Anjali Sharma](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8tc66sMn9Kjt2Wf5H9O-TMqZFQukoCQ1)- Excellent to understand MMU in detail<br>

## **2. Database Management Systems<br>**
[GateSmashers DBMS Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxCzCOWd7aiFAN6I8CuViBuCdJgiOkT2Y)- Full course content covered along with SQL queries<br>

- Some topics which you might miss out or won't understand in detail:<br>

  [Commonly Asked DBMS Questions Set 2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/commonly-asked-dbms-interview-questions-set-2/)<br>
  
 
 ## **3. Object Oriented Programming**
 I learnt OOPS from the GFG course I mentioned at the top<br>
 - Some topics you might miss out or wont understand in detail:<br>
   [Object Oriented Programming Concepts](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-in-cpp/#intro)<br>
   [Virtual Function](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-function-cpp/)<br>
   [Virtual Functions and Runtime Polymorphism ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-functions-and-runtime-polymorphism-in-c-set-1-introduction/)<br>
   [Override keyword](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/override-keyword-c/)<br>
   [Calling Functions and Overriding Behaviour](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/calling-inherited-functions-and-overriding-behavior/)<br>
   [final Specifier](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-final-specifier/)<br>
   [Association/Aggregation/Composition](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/association-composition-aggregation-java/)<br>
 - Some special C topics:<br>
   [Preprocessor Directives](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cc-preprocessors/)<br>
   [Dynamic Memory Allocation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/)<br>
   [Structure v/s Union](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-structure-union-c/)<br>
   [Storage Classes in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/storage-classes-in-c/)<br>
   
 ## **4. Data Structures & Algorithms** <br>
 This is an endless domain from Interviews point of view because anything can be asked<br>
 - Tips:<br>
   - Dont try to practice questions from all the famous websites at the same time (At the most 2 are enough), choose either GeeksForGeeks & InterviewBit OR GeeksForGeeks & Leetcode.<br> 
   - GFG is well balanced and should start with it asap<br>
   - Leetcode is a big ocean of Interview Questions with all difficulty levels<br>
   - InterviewBit is comparatively tough but extremely well structured<br>
   - **COMPANY ARCHIVES FROM GFG ARE MUST**<br>
   - Questions on [Sorting algorithms ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/) and [Stability in Sorting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stability-in-sorting-algorithms/) are also asked in Interviews
 
 ## **5. Object Oriented Design** <br>
 Low Level Design is enough for Internship Interviews<br>
 [System Design](https://crack-oop-system-design.herokuapp.com/)<br>
 
 ## **Miscellaneous**
[Topic wise multiple choice questions in computer science](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quiz-corner-gq/#DBMS%20Mock%20Tests)- Must go through to get a rough idea about the type of questions asked and gain little confidence<br>
[General Aptitude and Math](https://www.indiabix.com/)-For MCQs asked in Coding tests<br>
